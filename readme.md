Welcome to the hands-on workshop on Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Data Analysis. This session is designed to help you analyze Illumina-generated whole-genome resequencing (WGS) data for population genetics.
With minor adjustments, the same workflow can be applied to RAD-seq or amplicon-seq if a reference genome is available.

## Workshop Objectives: 

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Understand and process raw sequencing data (FASTQ format)
2. Perform quality control and preprocessing
3. Map reads to a reference genome
4. Call and filter variants (SNPs and indels)
5. Use filtered VCFs for population structure analysis (PCA, Admixture)


## Pre-requisites & Setup

- Access to a Unix/Linux shell environment
  - Windows: Install [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net)
  - Mac/Linux: Use native terminal
